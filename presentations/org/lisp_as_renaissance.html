              <p>Hi, I'm Sam!</p>

              <p>Going to talk about sicmutils.</p>

              <p>
                And this idea that CODE can be a fantastic medium for
                communication. There is so much promise:
              </p>

              <p>
                Code is a medium to communicate. But it’s also a medium we use
                to <i>build</i>
                systems.
              </p>

              <p>
                To the extent that the system is self-describing, it also
                performs itself. So there is huge promise for the idea of code
                as communication, and lots of champions!

                toolmakers get heat for not using them, because it’s so tough.

                Thrashing around with python and build systems&#x2026; that is

                there is no way it is going to lead to discoveries here.

              The problem with Literate Programming is that you really want a
              culture of literate programming, so that you can build on all of
              this stuff together. I’m imagining something like the AI memos, or
              email but where everyone is reading in emacs and you can just fire
              code around, save it etc. Before all of this version control
              nonsense.

            <p>
              Science is not just about communication. The progression of
              science has been inherently multiplayer; so the
              <span class="underline"><span class="underline">nice</span></span>
              thing about the PDF is you can print it out and sit in your chair
              and puzzle over what you’re seeing. And then make notes in the
              margins that potentially lead to the next brick in the wall.
            </p>

            <p>
              A WEAKNESS with existing stuff is that it’s all geared toward
              presentations. 3b1b style, for example. Brilliant! But it’s a
              presentation. It’s not a "viewer" where I can check out my own
              transformations, play, etc etc

              Something odd happens when the machine is involved. We GLEEFULLY
              abstain from ironing out and understanding it all, because the
              machine can perform the thing! Maybe that is like some old-timer
              in the lab who can work the fridge. But then we lose the
              knowledge.

                So let’s get rid of the expression derivative \(d/dt\) and
                replace it with an appropriate functional derivative. If \(f\)
                is a function then we will write \(Df\) as the new function that
                is the derivative of \(f\)
              </p>

              <p>
                To do this for the Lagrange equation we need to construct a
                function to take the derivative of.

            <p>
              Lisp, the computational fluid, is something eery and special. It’s
              not
              <i>everything</i>; remember, these are just models! But it’s a big
              deal.
            </p>

            <p>What are we going to do with it?</p>

            <p>
              the whole industry is so frothy, money, excitement, gleefully
              jettisoning the original values. Which is all great, of course,
              except it seems like it’s not
              <i>allowed</i> to go work on inspiring stuff, even though there is
              far more money.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the same time, what, we’re gonna change the world by working on
              developer tools?
