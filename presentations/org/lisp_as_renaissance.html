                code can communicate.

              <p>
                BY THE WAY, the way you derive this is just bananas, such a
                great way to THINK.

                lots of problems, getting more complex. Solving them depends on
                culture transmission.
              </p>

              <p>
                that turns out to be getting harder, and if you don’t get in at
                the beginning of this funnel&#x2026; Looking at our best tools,
                we see impressionistic notation and insular groups.
              </p>

              <p>
                And ALSO we see in a culture this suspicion and fear that has
                people taking potshots at "science", because it is damned hard
                and lives in people’s heads.
              </p>

              <p>
                Because things are more complicated, we need ways to communicate
                the culture more clearly.
              </p>

              <p>
                So we have to port it all into the machine. Code is a better
                medium for communication! Self-documenting!

              <p>
                It seems that code being so powerful at getting things done has
                gotten us off of the hook of consolidating complexity into the
                culture. If you

            <p>
              Knowledge does not _<sub>live</sub>_<sub>in</sub> the symbols; it
              lives in the culture. It lives by being taught.
            </p>

            <p>
              Code is a medium to communicate. But it’s also a medium we use to
              <span class="underline"
                ><span class="underline">build</span></span
              >
              systems.
            </p>

            <p>
              To the extent that the system is self-describing, it also performs
              itself. So there is huge promise for the idea of code as
              communication, and lots of champions!

            <p>
              A PROBLEM here is that these cultures are fairly insular now,
              because they are so well developed. So much of the communication
              occurs in this <i>shorthand</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
              And you can see it by trying to go function in a related world:
              Wikipedia, for some abstract mathematical structure — oh, these
              are all technical definitions!
            </p>

            <p>
              There is so much <i>culture</i>. So the question is, how to, see
              Book: Future of Education, transfer this element of the culture,
              to make tools that have some of the culture embodied in them?

              The problem with Literate Programming is that you really want a
              culture of literate programming, so that you can build on all of
              this stuff together. I’m imagining something like the AI memos, or
              email but where everyone is reading in emacs and you can just fire
              code around, save it etc. Before all of this version control
              nonsense.

              Something odd happens when the machine is involved. We GLEEFULLY
              abstain from ironing out and understanding it all, because the
              machine can perform the thing! Maybe that is like some old-timer
              in the lab who can work the fridge. But then we lose the

                Just for grins, I've attached a snapshot of what I'm doing right
                now with Chocolate Fix in Clojure. If you've never worked with
                Lisp, you'll probably find the program to be completely
                inscrutable, but I assure you, it's an elegant thing of beauty
                :) . Anyway, this will at least give you a small taste of what
