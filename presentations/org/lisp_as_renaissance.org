#+Title: Lisp as Renaissance Workshop

* Lisp as Renaissance Workshop

A Lispy Tour through Mathematical Physics

* Abstract
#+begin_notes
Lisp is an exquisite medium for the communication of computational ideas. From
our most accurate observations of physical reality up through chemistry,
biology, and cognition, the universe seems to be computing itself; modeling and
simulating these systems in machines has led to incredible technological wealth.

Deep principles and beautiful abstractions seem to drive these systems, but they
have always been hard to discover; and we are floundering at the computational
frontiers of intelligence, synthetic biology and control systems for our
climate. The only way to push forward is to build powerful tools that can
communicate and teach.

This talk will take a tour through SICMUtils, a Lisp system designed as a
workshop for conducting serious work in mathematical physics and sharing those
explorations in a deeply interactive, multiplayer way. The libraryâ€™s growth
parallels our human scientific history; hopefully tools like this will help us
write the next chapter.
