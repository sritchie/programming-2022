#+Title: Lisp as Renaissance Workshop
#+Subtitle: A Lispy Tour through Mathematical Physics

#+begin_comment

Tasks:

- [ ] future of education quote, get this from the book
- [ ] zettelkasten, get a picture
- [ ] get the action formula, brush up on that for the beginning idea

for demos:
- [ ] tidy up the text inside each of the demos. (DONE I think?)

* Lisp as Renaissance Workshop
#+begin_notes
Hi, I'm Sam!

Going to talk about sicmutils.

And this idea that CODE can be a fantastic medium for communication. There is so
much promise:

Code is a medium to communicate. But it’s also a medium we use to /build/
systems.

To the extent that the system is self-describing, it also performs itself. So
there is huge promise for the idea of code as communication, and lots of
champions!

** Disappointment!
#+begin_notes
Then we get to the Google gig. We have this __rot__ going on, where __tools for
thought__ is championed outside the world — often by people that are very
idealistic and thing that this is the way things __should work__ — inherently
gifty, Gift Economy like.

But then the folks using the tools despise the tools. And the toolmakers get
heat for not using them, because it’s so tough. Rare exceptions.

Thrashing around with python and build systems... that is NOT what folks finding
the deep principles behind QM were doing, there is no way it is going to lead to
discoveries here.

No one uses any analogue of lab notebook. Best is snippets pasted into Google
Chat.

* Problems with Code as Comms

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow)
- Literate Programming
- Real Science is Multiplayer
- Dynamic is Too Seductive
- LP is one-way
- Real Work doesn't happen here

** LP

The problem with Literate Programming is that you really want a culture of
literate programming, so that you can build on all of this stuff together. I’m
imagining something like the AI memos, or email but where everyone is reading in
emacs and you can just fire code around, save it etc. Before all of this version
control nonsense.

** Real Science is Multiplayer

Science is not just about communication. The progression of science has been
inherently multiplayer; so the __nice__ thing about the PDF is you can print it
out and sit in your chair and puzzle over what you’re seeing. And then make
notes in the margins that potentially lead to the next brick in the wall.

A WEAKNESS with existing stuff is that it’s all geared toward presentations.
3b1b style, for example. Brilliant! But it’s a presentation. It’s not a "viewer"
where I can check out my own transformations, play, etc etc

** Dynamic == Too Seductive

It is too seductive, people just want the code to __work__: but the alternative
is what, thrashing around with python code?

Something odd happens when the machine is involved. We GLEEFULLY abstain from
ironing out and understanding it all, because the machine can perform the thing!
Maybe that is like some old-timer in the lab who can work the fridge. But then
we lose the knowledge.

** Literate == one way

ALSO: as a reader, I can't participate in the cultural thing that created the
document!

This is also the problem with notebooks. They are often so dependent on the
user's local environment... I read the thing but it was not designed to be
shared. Yes, I know about Docker etc...

SO — and this is personal for me — I want to bring more of the teaching and
explaining back into real software, into things you can use for real work in a
lab.

** People are not doing "real work" in these systems

Same with LOGO, with Notebooks. you have to bail out at some point.

* Why does it matter?
#+begin_notes
These are the crown jewels of our society!

We have many problems left that this computational fluid seems quite useful for.

not to mention that this is a beautiful THING we have figured out how to do,
this sense that abstraction is all around. If it is true of the universe where
we’re living, music, art, wow, better practice.

The ability to do long term projects depends on the transmission of culture over
long distances and times. With our current stuff, the harder the material gets,
the more specialized the field gets, the more impressionistic the notation gets.

How does the way out of the climate crisis, issues like that not depend on
developing a deep intuition around control systems, physical models, physical
simulations and nonlinear feedback?

** Future of Education Quote

* Explanation as Side Effect

Zettelkasten. Then you go tidy it up for someone else.

The dream environment is one where just playing in public leaves a record of
what you did, and is shareable. See Zettelkasten for notes on what to do here.
That was the beauty of the Roam promise.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <img height="500" src="../images/sicm.jpeg">
#+REVEAL_HTML: <img height="500" src="../images/fdg.jpeg">

** Textbook as Nurse Tree

Get a picture of a nurse log...

Physics and the Book: The Road to Reality. The textbook sort of is a starter
pack. It’s a library already, it’s a nurse tree. It purports to tell you
everything! And in principle it’s all computable and full of abstraction
goodies.

And THAT is the culture I want to soak up!

- We have this grand human tale, over thousands of years, of figuring out how
  the world works. Of how to model reality.

The library that lives in all of these environments, and is fissionable and extensible.

The idea being that the textbook is explicitly about the subject; but actually a
model of exposition, of scientific communication.

And the __exercises__ are an invitation to publish your own original thoughts,
to participate in the discovery process yourself. But often with no way to
practice the publication part. (The discovery has already happened, so why are
we only practicing getting the answer? The goal is to __share__ it in a way that
ignores someone else.)

And the PIECES the library kicks out are usable elsewhere.

Go from:

- Lagrange equations, let's say WHAT WE MEAN
- the expanded version
- the clojure code
- the animation

This has pretty crappy flow now but I think this section is a pretty important
one, to talk about what it MEANS to say that code can communicate.

BY THE WAY, the way you derive this is just bananas, such a great way to THINK.

- [ ] so add a slide about the integral T-V vs where you get...

you'll find you might get sleepy for a few slides; but I will own it by saying
that is kind of the point!

** Substitutions
#+begin_notes
So let’s get rid of the expression derivative $d/dt$ and replace it with an
appropriate functional derivative. If $f$ is a function then we will write
$Df$ as the new function that is the derivative of $f$

To do this for the Lagrange equation we need to construct a function to take
the derivative of.

our friend Gamma...

Boom, we have F = ma, because F = ma has to be true. So we have Hooke's law
here.

Actually you can look at the general form... but the POINT is that it's
confusing!!!

* Clerk Demo
#+begin_notes
- spring demo
- the physics examples
- function examples
- John video?
- THE LIBRARY ITSELF is written
   - show autodiff, numerical methods
- the slides themselves have math generated by sicmutils
- Nextjournal environment
- Double Pendulum style essay...
- einstein's field equations, pre-load that into the system

Then I'll show you another one that is just bonkers.

- the library itself is written up as a series of computational essays that
  render in the browser.

SO, these "essays" are also little libraries!

You can publish them as little "research papers"
#+end_notes

That was not very clear! So let's convince ourselves that that is true, by doing
the spring demo in the browser.

* How to get involved? What's Next?
#+begin_notes
so why is this interesting?

Basically we know the material is good — so how compelling AND SIMULTANEOUSLY
USEFUL can we make the presentation? Fascinating all the way down! the workshop!
#+end_notes

- Collaborative editing, simulation
- Full library as essays
- Steal the pieces!
- Build things like this!

* Conclusion

Lisp, the computational fluid, is something eery and special. It’s not
/everything/; remember, these are just models! But it’s a big deal.

What are we going to do with it?

the whole industry is so frothy, money, excitement, gleefully jettisoning the
original values. Which is all great, of course, except it seems like it’s not
/allowed/ to go work on inspiring stuff, even though there is far more money.

At the same time, what, we’re gonna change the world by working on developer
tools?
