# <programming> 2022

Hello! This will flesh out over the next few days.

The presentations themselves live in `presentations/org/*.html`. see
`presentations/README.md` for more detail.

To run the code in the notebooks, run this plus a few commands I haven't yet documented...
```
npm install
shadow-cljs watch sicm-browser
```

## Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Document how to install shadow-cljs
- [ ] Document how to run each of the clerk notebooks
